# 🔧 REGISTRATION FIXED - CORS ISSUE RESOLVED

## ❌ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
The registration was failing in preview because of a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issue:
- Frontend was trying to connect from preview domain
- Backend CORS was only allowing specific domains
- OPTIONS requests were being blocked (400 Bad Request)

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

### 🔧 **CORS Configuration Fixed**
Updated backend CORS settings to allow:
- ✅ `https://buildyoursmartcart.com` (production)
- ✅ `http://localhost:3000` (development)  
- ✅ `http://localhost:8001` (local backend)
- ✅ `https://407d4e17-1478-4b87-bdc3-d8a695a6f09c.preview.emergentagent.com` (preview)
- ✅ `*` (all origins for preview testing)

### 🔧 **Methods & Headers**
- ✅ Added `OPTIONS` method support
- ✅ Allow all headers with credentials
- ✅ Support for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE

### 🔄 **Services Restarted**
- ✅ Backend restarted with new CORS config
- ✅ Frontend restarted for fresh connection
- ✅ Service worker updated to v103

## 🧪 **VERIFICATION COMPLETE**
- ✅ **CORS Test**: OPTIONS requests now return 200 OK
- ✅ **Registration Test**: Successfully created preview_test@example.com
- ✅ **Email Service**: Verification code sent successfully
- ✅ **Backend Logs**: No more 400 CORS errors
