# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "User (Alan.nunez0310@icloud.com) reports that the new recipe detail UI with instructions, ingredients, and Walmart cart is not showing up. The user wants to ensure the new modern two-column UI is being used and any old code is permanently deleted. The recipe page should show instructions, ingredients, Walmart URL, prices, and total price in a clean modern design. The issue appears to be a caching problem preventing the user from seeing the updated UI."

RESULTS: 1) Total recipes tested: 10 (3 Cuisine, 3 Snacks, 4 Beverages), 2) API success rate: 100% (13/13 successful calls), 3) Shopping list consistency score: 96.0% - EXCELLENT rating. VALIDATION CRITERIA: ✅ Has shopping_list field: 100% (10/10), ✅ Shopping list format valid: 100% (10/10), ✅ No quantities in shopping list: 100% (10/10), ✅ No measurements in shopping list: 90% (9/10), ✅ Individual spices listed: 90% (9/10). CATEGORY BREAKDOWN: Cuisine (100% perfect), Snacks (89% - minor generic spice issue), Beverages (95% - minor measurement unit issue). SPECIFIC TESTS: Italian Spaghetti Carbonara, Mexican Street Tacos, Japanese Matcha Latte, Superfood Acai Bowl, Spicy Fruit Lemon Slices, Frozen Yogurt Berry Bites, Caramel Macchiato, Brown Sugar Boba Tea, Authentic Thai Tea, Tropical Fruit Lemonade. All recipes generated proper shopping lists with clean ingredient names, no quantities/measurements, and individual spices. Beverages correctly implemented 'secret recipe' format with detailed measurements in ingredients but clean shopping lists. The shopping_list field is consistently implemented across all three categories with excellent formatting and adherence to requirements."

The /api/grocery/custom-cart endpoint correctly calculates the total price based on product quantities and generates a properly formatted Walmart affiliate URL with all product IDs.

Created a test recipe with common ingredients (pasta, tomatoes, garlic) and successfully called the /api/grocery/cart-options endpoint. Verified that we are now getting real Walmart product IDs (found 15 real product IDs and 0 mock product IDs) instead of mock data. The signature generation is working correctly as evidenced by successful API calls to the Walmart API. The backend logs show successful Walmart API calls with proper response data. The custom cart endpoint correctly generates a Walmart affiliate URL with all product IDs and calculates the total price accurately. The Walmart API integration is now fully functional with real product data."

The _extract_core_ingredient function correctly extracts the core ingredients: 'chickpeas', 'barbecue sauce', 'quinoa', 'frozen mixed vegetables', 'avocado', 'olive oil', and 'salt pepper'. The function successfully handles all test cases, removing quantities, measurements, and preparation instructions to extract the core ingredient names. This improved parsing logic ensures that the Walmart API can find relevant product options for each ingredient, even when they are specified with detailed preparation instructions."

The complete flow from registration → verification → login works as expected. The debug endpoint for getting verification codes works correctly. Password validation is properly implemented, rejecting passwords shorter than 6 characters."
