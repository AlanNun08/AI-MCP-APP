    message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Complete Walmart integration workflow testing revealed that the backend is 100% operational but the frontend has a critical user session management bug. ✅ BACKEND CONFIRMED WORKING: Direct API testing shows recipe generation and Walmart cart options working perfectly with authentic products. ❌ FRONTEND SESSION ISSUE: User authentication works initially but session is lost on page reload/navigation, preventing access to dashboard and Walmart features. Console logs show 'User state cleared, Screen: landing' repeatedly. Users cannot complete the workflow: Register/Login → Dashboard → Generate Recipe → Recipe History → Recipe Details → Walmart Integration. The Walmart integration display is not the issue - the issue is users cannot reach the features due to broken session persistence. RECOMMENDATION: Fix frontend localStorage session management in App.js to maintain user state across page reloads."
