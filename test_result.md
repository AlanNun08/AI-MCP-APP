# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "User (Alan.nunez0310@icloud.com) reports that the new recipe detail UI with instructions, ingredients, and Walmart cart is not showing up. The user wants to ensure the new modern two-column UI is being used and any old code is permanently deleted. The recipe page should show instructions, ingredients, Walmart URL, prices, and total price in a clean modern design.

ROOT CAUSE: When users selected 'Beverages' category, the dropdown was showing difficulty options (Easy, Medium, Hard) instead of beverage types (Coffee, Lemonade, Thai Tea, Boba), preventing users from generating proper beverage recipes. FIXES APPLIED: 1) Fixed beverage card onClick handler to properly clear beverage_type field, 2) Added unique data-testid attributes for better element identification, 3) Fixed authentication by updating REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to localhost:8001, 4) Updated cache to force refresh.

The /api/grocery/cart-options endpoint successfully returns multiple product options for each ingredient with all required fields (product_id, name, price). The /api/grocery/custom-cart endpoint correctly calculates the total price based on product quantities and generates a properly formatted Walmart affiliate URL with all product IDs. Error handling is implemented for missing recipe_id parameter (returns 422 Unprocessable Entity). The API correctly handles quantity adjustments and includes them in the total price calculation. All core functionality for the enhanced interactive cart is working as expected."

Created a test recipe with common ingredients (pasta, tomatoes, garlic) and successfully called the /api/grocery/cart-options endpoint. Verified that we are now getting real Walmart product IDs (found 15 real product IDs and 0 mock product IDs) instead of mock data. The signature generation is working correctly as evidenced by successful API calls to the Walmart API. The backend logs show successful Walmart API calls with proper response data. The custom cart endpoint correctly generates a Walmart affiliate URL with all product IDs and calculates the total price accurately. The Walmart API integration is now fully functional with real product data."

The _extract_core_ingredient function correctly extracts the core ingredients: 'chickpeas', 'barbecue sauce', 'quinoa', 'frozen mixed vegetables', 'avocado', 'olive oil', and 'salt pepper'. The function successfully handles all test cases, removing quantities, measurements, and preparation instructions to extract the core ingredient names. This improved parsing logic ensures that the Walmart API can find relevant product options for each ingredient, even when they are specified with detailed preparation instructions."

RESULTS: 100% success rate (16/16 tests passed). ‚úÖ SINGLE RECIPE GENERATION: Each beverage type now generates ONLY that specific beverage recipe, not all 4 types. ‚úÖ PROPER STRUCTURE: All responses have correct single recipe format with title, description, ingredients, instructions, and shopping_list. ‚úÖ TYPE ACCURACY: Coffee requests generate only coffee recipes, Lemonade requests generate only lemonade recipes, etc. ‚úÖ NO CROSS-CONTAMINATION: No other beverage types appear in responses. ‚úÖ SHOPPING LIST CLEAN: All shopping lists contain clean ingredient names without quantities/measurements. ‚úÖ MODE COMPATIBILITY: Healthy mode (300-350 calories) and Budget mode ($10-12) work correctly with all beverage types. ‚úÖ WALMART INTEGRATION: Cart-options endpoint working with real Walmart product IDs and prices. The beverage type selection fix is deployment-ready and users will receive exactly the beverage type they select."

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FAILURE PREVENTS BEVERAGE DROPDOWN TESTING! Attempted comprehensive testing of the beverage dropdown fix but encountered complete authentication system breakdown. DETAILED FINDINGS: ‚ùå Debug Endpoint Missing: '/api/debug/verification-code' returns 404 error - cannot retrieve verification codes for new registrations. ‚ùå All Login Attempts Failed: Tested multiple credential combinations (test@example.com, admin@test.com, user@test.com, demo@demo.com, sarah.johnson@test.com) - every single login attempt returned 401 Unauthorized errors. ‚ùå No Access to Recipe Generation: Cannot reach the recipe generation screen where beverage dropdown testing needs to occur due to authentication blocking all authenticated features. ‚ùå Backend API Issues: Console shows repeated 401 errors from /api/auth/login endpoint indicating backend authentication service problems. IMPACT: Unable to verify if the beverage dropdown fix (showing Coffee, Lemonade, Thai Tea, Boba instead of Easy, Medium, Hard) is working because authentication completely blocks access to the recipe generation functionality. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE MAIN AGENT ATTENTION: Authentication system must be restored before beverage dropdown testing can be completed. The frontend loads correctly but all core functionality requiring authentication is completely inaccessible."

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE BLOCKING BEVERAGE DROPDOWN TESTING! Unable to test the beverage dropdown functionality due to Kubernetes ingress/routing configuration problems. DETAILED FINDINGS: ‚ùå ROUTING ISSUE: Browser automation tool cannot access frontend - attempts to reach localhost:8001 return 'Not Found' error instead of serving the React app. ‚ùå SERVICE VERIFICATION: Frontend runs correctly on localhost:3000 (confirmed via curl), backend runs on localhost:8001 (API endpoints working), but ingress routing is broken. ‚ùå KUBERNETES ENVIRONMENT: Detected preview proxy service (34.118.225.58:80) but ingress controller not properly routing frontend traffic to port 3000. ‚ùå CODE ANALYSIS: Reviewed App.js code - data-testid attributes are properly implemented (beverage-type-select, difficulty-select), beverageOptions array contains correct values ['boba tea', 'thai tea', 'coffee', 'special lemonades']. ‚ùå TESTING BLOCKED: Cannot verify if main agent's beverage dropdown fix is working because infrastructure prevents access to the React application. IMPACT: The beverage dropdown fix cannot be validated due to deployment/infrastructure issues, not code problems. REQUIRES: Infrastructure team to fix Kubernetes ingress routing so frontend is accessible through expected URL pattern for testing."

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL WALMART INTEGRATION ISSUE CONFIRMED! Comprehensive testing reveals that mock product IDs are still being returned by the Walmart API integration, exactly as the user reported. DETAILED FINDINGS: ‚ùå MOCK PRODUCT IDs DETECTED: Found 3 mock product IDs with '10315' pattern: 10315162 (sugar), 10315012 (sugar), 10315103 (olive oil). ‚ùå MIXED DATA: System returns 35 real Walmart product IDs but mixes them with mock data, contaminating affiliate links. ‚ùå VALIDATION FAILURE: Custom cart endpoint doesn't properly reject mock product IDs (returns 500 error instead of 400). ‚ùå USER IMPACT: Affiliate URLs contain both real and mock product IDs, causing the exact issue user reported. ‚úÖ POSITIVE FINDINGS: Real Walmart API integration works (35 real products found), shopping lists are clean without quantities/measurements, recipe generation works for beverages and complex ingredients. üö® ROOT CAUSE: The _get_walmart_product_options function in server.py is not filtering out all mock data patterns. The '10315' pattern mock products are passing through the validation.
