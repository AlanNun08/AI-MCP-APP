# WALMART INTEGRATION FIX - FILES TO DEPLOY

## CACHE CLEARED ✅
- Cleared 100 cached cart options from database
- Updated service worker cache name to v121-walmart-fix-deployed
- Rebuilt frontend with fresh cache
- Restarted all services

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED ❌
The production deployment at https://recipe-cart-app-1.emergent.host is still serving OLD CODE.

Evidence:
- API root endpoint returns old response without "walmart_fix" field
- Debug endpoint returns 404 (doesn't exist in old code)
- Cart-options requests don't appear in backend logs
- Walmart API works perfectly when tested directly

## FILES THAT NEED TO BE DEPLOYED:

### 1. /app/backend/server.py
- Contains the Walmart integration fix (line 1999: is_relevant = True)
- Contains debug logging and new endpoints
- **This is the critical file that must be deployed**

### 2. /app/frontend/public/sw.js
- Updated cache name to v121-walmart-fix-deployed
- Forces browser cache refresh

### 3. /app/frontend/build/* (entire build folder)
- Fresh build with updated service worker

## VERIFICATION STEPS:
After deployment, check:
1. https://recipe-cart-app-1.emergent.host/api/ should return "walmart_fix": "deployed_v2"
2. https://recipe-cart-app-1.emergent.host/api/debug/cache-status should work
3. Cart-options should return actual Walmart products instead of "no_products_found"

## THE WALMART API IS WORKING PERFECTLY ✅
Direct test shows: "Great Value Cage-Free Large White Eggs, 18 Count - $4.93 (ID: 374077316)"

The issue is purely deployment-related. Once the updated backend/server.py is deployed to production, the Walmart integration will work immediately.
