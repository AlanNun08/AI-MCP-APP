# 🎉 WALMART API INTEGRATION FIXED FOR BUILDYOURSMARTCART.COM

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

### **🔍 Root Cause Identified:**
The Walmart API authentication was failing because the signature generation was using **HMAC-SHA256** instead of **RSA-SHA256**. 

**Error:** "Signature length not correct: got 32 but was expecting 256"
- **HMAC signature**: 32 characters (incorrect)
- **RSA signature**: 344 characters (correct)

### **🔧 Fix Applied:**
Updated the `_get_walmart_signature()` function to use proper **RSA-SHA256** signing with the cryptography library.

### **✅ Results:**
- **Walmart API authentication**: Working ✓
- **Product search**: Returning real products ✓
- **All recipe categories**: Working ✓

## 🧪 **TESTED AND VERIFIED:**
