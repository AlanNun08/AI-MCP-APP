CRITICAL FOR BEVERAGE SHOPPING LIST: The shopping_list must contain ONLY clean ingredient names without any quantities, measurements, or preparation instructions. For beverages specifically:
- If ingredients include "4 lemons" and "1/2 cup pineapple chunks", the shopping_list should be ["lemons", "pineapple"]
- If ingredients include "2 shots espresso" and "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup", the shopping_list should be ["espresso beans", "brown sugar"]
- If ingredients include "1/4 cup fresh mint leaves" and "ice cubes", the shopping_list should be ["mint", "ice"]
- If ingredients include "1 cup oat milk" and "3/4 cup cooked tapioca pearls", the shopping_list should be ["oat milk", "tapioca pearls"]
- Remove ALL quantities (4, 1/2 cup, 2 shots, 1/4 cup, etc.) and measurements (cups, tablespoons, ounces)

### CUISINE

---

## Shopping List Guidelines

The shopping_list should be a separate bullet-pointed shopping list that includes only the names of the ingredients (no amounts, no measurements). For example:

- If ingredients include "1 cup diced tomatoes" and "2 tbsp olive oil", the shopping_list should be ["tomatoes", "olive oil"]
- If ingredients include "1 can chickpeas, drained" and "1/2 cup BBQ sauce", the shopping_list should be ["chickpeas", "BBQ sauce"]
- If beverage ingredients include "2 shots espresso" and "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup", the shopping_list should be ["espresso beans", "brown sugar"]
- **BEVERAGE SPECIFIC**: If ingredients include "4 lemons", "1/2 cup pineapple chunks", "1/4 cup fresh mint leaves", the shopping_list should be ["lemons", "pineapple", "mint"]
- **BEVERAGE SPECIFIC**: If ingredients include "1 cup oat milk", "ice cubes", "1/2 cup honey", the shopping_list should be ["oat milk", "ice", "honey"]
- Clean ingredient names without quantities, measurements, or preparation instructions

### Beverage Ingredients Format Examples:
- "2 shots espresso" instead of "espresso"
- "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup" instead of "brown sugar"
- "1 cup oat milk" instead of "milk"
- "3/4 cup cooked tapioca pearls" instead of "tapioca"

---

## Example Beverage Recipes (Reference)

Create 4 unique recipes similar to these:
- **Coffee**: Salted Caramel Cold Foam Macchiato with vanilla syrup and sea salt
- **Lemonade**: Lavender Honey Lemonade with fresh herbs and edible flowers  
- **Thai Tea**: Coconut Mango Thai Tea with layered presentation and tropical fruit
- **Boba**: Taro Coconut Milk Tea with homemade taro paste and chewy tapioca pearls

---

## Important Notes for Spices

If the recipe uses spices, list each spice individually in the shopping_list instead of using generic terms like "spices" or "seasoning". For example:

- If ingredients include "2 tsp mixed spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander)", the shopping_list should include ["turmeric", "cumin", "coriander"]
- If ingredients include "1 tbsp garam masala and chili powder", the shopping_list should include ["garam masala", "chili powder"] 
- If ingredients include "salt, pepper, and paprika to taste", the shopping_list should include ["salt", "pepper", "paprika"]
- This ensures users can select specific spices and brands from Walmart rather than searching for generic "spices"
