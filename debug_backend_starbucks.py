}

Recipe Category Guidelines:

SNACKS: Focus on healthy and refreshing snack options such as:
- Acai bowls (frozen acai puree, granola, fresh berries, honey, superfoods)
- Fruit lemon slices chili (fresh fruits, lemon juice, chili powder, lime, Mexican spices)
- Frozen yogurt berry bites (Greek yogurt, mixed berries, natural sweeteners, bite-sized treats)

BEVERAGES: Generate specific beverage recipes based on user selection:

1. LEMONADE-BASED DRINK: Refreshing, fruity, or herbal lemonades perfect for summer with unique fruit combinations, natural sweeteners, and fresh herbs

2. THAI TEA-BASED DRINK: Authentic Thai tea layered or infused with other flavors (fruit, spices, milk alternatives, or syrups) with traditional preparation methods

3. BOBA DRINK: Milk-based or fruit-based bubble tea using tapioca, popping boba, or creative textures with authentic bubble tea shop quality

For each beverage, include:
üßã Creative, original drink name
‚ú® Brief flavor description (1‚Äì2 sentences that describe taste and style)
üßæ List of ingredients with exact quantities and units (cups, tablespoons, ounces)
üç≥ Step-by-step instructions including brewing, mixing, and serving techniques
üí° Optional tips or variations (e.g., vegan swap, flavor twist, serving method)

Make each drink visually Instagram-worthy with professional techniques (shaking, layering, temperature control).

CRITICAL FOR BEVERAGE SHOPPING LIST: The shopping_list must contain ONLY clean ingredient names without any quantities, measurements, or preparation instructions. For beverage specifically:
- If ingredients include "2 shots espresso" and "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup", the shopping_list should be ["espresso beans", "brown sugar"]
- If ingredients include "1/4 cup fresh mint leaves" and "ice cubes", the shopping_list should be ["mint", "ice"]
- If ingredients include "1 cup oat milk" and "3/4 cup cooked tapioca pearls", the shopping_list should be ["oat milk", "tapioca pearls"]
- Remove ALL quantities (2 shots, 1/2 cup, 1/4 cup, etc.) and measurements (cups, tablespoons, ounces)
- Remove ALL preparation words (fresh, cooked, diced, chopped, etc.)
- Use clean, searchable ingredient names suitable for Walmart product search

Example beverage ingredients format:
- "2 shots espresso" instead of "espresso"
- "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup" instead of "brown sugar"
- "1 cup oat milk" instead of "milk"
- "3/4 cup cooked tapioca pearls" instead of "tapioca"

CUISINE: Traditional dishes from specific cultures and regions with authentic ingredients and cooking methods.

The shopping_list should be a separate bullet-pointed shopping list that includes only the names of the ingredients (no amounts, no measurements). For example:
- If ingredients include "1 cup diced tomatoes" and "2 tbsp olive oil", the shopping_list should be ["tomatoes", "olive oil"]
- If ingredients include "1 can chickpeas, drained" and "1/2 cup BBQ sauce", the shopping_list should be ["chickpeas", "BBQ sauce"]
- If beverage ingredients include "2 shots espresso" and "1/2 cup brown sugar syrup", the shopping_list should be ["espresso beans", "brown sugar"]
- BEVERAGE SPECIFIC: If ingredients include "4 lemons", "1/2 cup pineapple chunks", "1/4 cup fresh mint leaves", the shopping_list should be ["lemons", "pineapple", "mint"]
- BEVERAGE SPECIFIC: If ingredients include "1 cup oat milk", "ice cubes", "1/2 cup honey", the shopping_list should be ["oat milk", "ice", "honey"]
- Clean ingredient names without quantities, measurements, or preparation instructions

BEVERAGE EXAMPLES for reference (create one specific recipe based on user selection):
- Lemonade: Lavender Honey Lemonade with fresh herbs and edible flowers  
- Thai Tea: Coconut Mango Thai Tea with layered presentation and tropical fruit
- Boba: Taro Coconut Milk Tea with homemade taro paste and chewy tapioca pearls

IMPORTANT FOR SPICES: If the recipe uses spices, list each spice individually in the shopping_list instead of using generic terms like "spices" or "seasoning". For example:
- If ingredients include "2 tsp mixed spices (turmeric, cumin, coriander)", the shopping_list should include ["turmeric", "cumin", "coriander"]
- If ingredients include "1 tbsp garam masala and chili powder", the shopping_list should include ["garam masala", "chili powder"] 
- If ingredients include "salt, pepper, and paprika to taste", the shopping_list should include ["salt", "pepper", "paprika"]
- This ensures users can select specific spices and brands from Walmart rather than searching for generic "spices"
