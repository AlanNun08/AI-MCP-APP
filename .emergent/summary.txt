The previous AI engineer successfully established an AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App from scratch, integrating OpenAI for recipes, Mailjet for email verification, and Walmart API for grocery carts, and converting it to a PWA. The recent trajectory shows the engineer's iterative approach to bug fixing and UI/UX refinement. Key issues included persistent frontend caching preventing UI updates, and the Generate Walmart Shopping Cart function failing, particularly for recipes loaded from history. The engineer diligently added and removed debug logs, rebuilt the frontend multiple times, restarted services, and involved a  to diagnose persistent deployment/preview issues, which identified a potential configuration/caching problem with the  and the serving of old code. Despite numerous attempts to force updates and debug, the user continued to report issues with visible changes and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is an AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App with several core features. This includes personalized AI recipe generation (healthy/budget modes) via OpenAI, real-time Walmart product search and pre-filled cart URL generation, comprehensive user management (account creation, preferences, saved recipes), and mobile compatibility via PWA/Capacitor. A critical requirement was a robust email verification system using Mailjet for registration, password reset, and intelligent handling of unverified users. The application also needs a streamlined workflow for recipe details and one-click grocery ordering, addressing common browser issues. Continuous UI/UX polish is emphasized for a spotless and professional experience, alongside ensuring the application's stability and deployment readiness with data persistence and reliable integrations.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with distinct frontend and backend components.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application for user auth, recipe generation, and grocery cart.
    -   **Changes**: Previously modified for email verification, password hashing, password reset, and unverified user handling. In this trajectory, it was updated to adjust **CORS configuration** (allowing specific origins for production) and debug endpoints were temporarily added/removed. Mocking of  for sample data remained crucial.
-   **/app/backend/email_service.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Handles Mailjet API integration and email sending.
    -   **Changes**: Previously updated to correctly use environment variables. No direct code changes were made in this trajectory, but its functionality relies on the updated  keys.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes**:  and  were added previously. No further changes in this trajectory.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores sensitive backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Previously added , , and . **Crucially, the  and  were updated to new user-provided values ( and  respectively) in this trajectory.**
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component managing UI, routing, global state, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive modifications. During this trajectory, the UI for **grocery cart item display** was improved, making prices and the Walmart URL more prominent. Extensive **debugging console logs were added** to  and  functions to diagnose the non-working Walmart cart generation, especially when loading recipes from history. These logs were subsequently **removed** multiple times for deployment/preview readiness. Logic related to  for recipe history was investigated and implicitly debugged by adding logging.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Summary**: Contains global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Updated previously to support new UI. No direct changes in this trajectory, but it is implicitly affected by UI improvements in .
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**: Contains . This file was inspected multiple times to verify the backend URL configuration, especially during troubleshooting of frontend connectivity issues and ensuring it aligns with the preview URL.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting persistent issues with the Generate Walmart Shopping Cart button and recipes not loading from history, despite multiple attempts to prepare the application for preview/deployment. The core problem identified, initially by a , was a suspected frontend caching/build issue preventing the latest code from being served, and potentially a  accessibility issue, although backend logs showed successful API calls.

The engineer's recent actions include:
1.  **Re-adding comprehensive debug logs** to the  function and  in  to trace data flow (recipe object, user object, API requests, responses, state updates) when the Walmart button is clicked, specifically addressing the scenario where recipes are accessed from history.
2.  **Forcing multiple complete frontend rebuilds** () and yarn install v1.22.22

4.  **Verifying backend connectivity** by directly querying API endpoints (e.g., , login) and inspecting frontend compiled JavaScript () to confirm the  is correctly embedded.
5.  **Instructing the user to hard refresh their browser or use an incognito window** to ensure they receive the updated frontend code.

Despite these efforts, the user reported that changes were not visible and that recipes were not loading, indicating a deep-seated caching or deployment-related problem that is preventing the user from seeing the applied fixes and debug logs. The engineer is currently trying to ensure the backend is fully connected to the frontend and the latest code is consistently served.

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to continue verifying frontend-backend connectivity and ensuring the latest frontend build is served to the user.
