The previous AI engineer spent significant effort debugging the AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App, primarily focusing on the persistent failure of the Walmart API integration and deployment inconsistencies. Initially, the problem was misdiagnosed as demo user authentication and aggressive relevance filtering. A major breakthrough revealed Python bytecode caching as the culprit, preventing code changes from reflecting in the deployed backend. However, even after addressing this, the core issue was confirmed to be client-side caching (browser/CDN), meaning the backend *was* deploying changes, but the user's browser showed stale data. Following a user-provided blueprint, the engineer began systematically rebuilding the Walmart integration, simplifying it to use mock data for reliability. The process involved extensive deletion and recreation of backend code related to Walmart, and a pivot to adapting the frontend () to the backend's *actual* (and still problematic) response format due to perceived backend deployment issues, rather than fixing the backend's output to match the desired format. The work halted while attempting to apply a large fix to .

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to enhance meal planning and grocery shopping. It features AI-generated recipes based on user inputs, a Walmart integration to match ingredients with products and generate affiliate links, a Starbucks Secret Menu Generator, and a user recipe sharing platform. Key requirements included robust user session management, frontend caching resolution, enhanced recipe history display, and full production readiness. The central recurring problem was the Walmart integration's failure on the deployed production site, specifically not displaying products or prices. The user explicitly requested ensuring the Walmart search products API is called after a recipe is generated.

    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend handling recipe generation, authentication, grocery cart (Walmart), and user recipe sharing.
    -   **Changes**: Initially debugged for Walmart integration (failed authentication, no products found), conflicting route decorators, and database connection. A  endpoint was added for deployment verification. Old Walmart functions (, ) and related endpoints () were repeatedly attempted to be deleted or replaced. A clean V2 integration for Walmart was introduced, initially in  then moved directly into . The  endpoint was eventually modified to use the V2 mock data logic. Recent changes involved attempting to align the backend's  response format (e.g.,  field,  sub-field, ) with frontend expectations, which proved challenging due to persistent deployment/caching issues for model serialization.

Due to the backend's persistent (and incorrect) output of , , and ,  was modified to adapt to these backend response field names, including updating API response handling, product image fields, and adding debug logging.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the persistent discrepancy between the backend's intended response format and its actual deployed output, specifically concerning the Walmart integration.

Despite previous attempts to fix the backend's response model to return  with  and , the deployed backend continued to return  with  and . This issue was compounded by recurring Python bytecode caching, which made it difficult to verify if backend changes were taking effect.

Given the user's frustration with repeated redeployments yielding no visible changes (which was eventually traced to client-side caching, not a deployment failure), the engineer decided to pivot. Instead of further debugging the backend's serialization and deployment reflection, the explicit instruction was to correct and replace all of app.js to make the frontend adapt to the *current, actual* (and inconsistent) backend response.

Therefore, the last phase of work involved modifying  to:
-   Consume the  field instead of .
-   Access product options via  instead of .
-   Use  for product images instead of .
-   Added extensive console logging and refined error handling to debug the frontend's interaction with the backend's inconsistent data.

A test run of the frontend confirmed it was loading and the changes to adapt to the backend format were in place. The very last action was an attempt to comprehensively fix , which failed due to the file being too large for a single  command, leading to a decision to split the fix into smaller chunks.
