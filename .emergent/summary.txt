The previous AI engineer demonstrated a highly iterative and problem-solving approach. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing core features like Walmart API integration, frontend caching, and authentication. A significant portion of the work then shifted to enhancing the Starbucks recipe generation with increasingly complex AI prompts, followed by implementing curated recipe sections and a full user recipe sharing platform with image uploads and a like system. Critically, the engineer meticulously handled environment configurations, diagnosing and fixing persistent issues related to preview vs. production URLs and service worker caching. The trajectory culminates in a comprehensive effort to purge all preview-related configurations and documentation, establishing a strict production-only development policy, and beginning work on refining the Walmart API integration for the production environment. This shows a transition from feature development to robust production readiness and policy enforcement.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to provide personalized AI-generated recipes, integrate with Walmart for real-time product search and one-click ordering, manage users, and include a Starbucks secret menu generator. Key requirements addressed include: resolving frontend caching to ensure UI updates; automating Walmart cart display with real product IDs; persisting user sessions; expanding recipe categories (e.g., Starbucks); removing unused code; implementing onboarding and tutorial screens; unifying recipe history display; and providing a standalone Starbucks generator. The user explicitly requested perfect functionality, persistent user sign-in, and full deployment readiness. Recent additions include enhancing Starbucks recipe generation with creative, drive-thru friendly prompts, introducing 30 curated Starbucks recipes categorized by drink type, and developing a comprehensive user recipe sharing system with photo uploads (base64 format), descriptions, tags, and a like functionality, all to be integrated into the production site.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core backend API, handling recipe generation, authentication, grocery cart, and Starbucks drink generation.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Starbucks Prompt Logic**: Modified to incorporate highly specific and creative prompts for Frappuccinos, Lemonades, Refreshers, Iced Matchas, and Random drinks. These prompts include creative constraints, name generation rules, surprise ingredient mechanics, and randomness seed phrases.
        -   **Curated Starbucks Recipes**: Added logic to store and retrieve 30 pre-made Starbucks recipes, categorized by drink type. New endpoints (, ) for accessing these.
        -   **User Recipe Sharing System**: Implemented new endpoints for user-uploaded recipes:  (for sharing with image, tags, difficulty, etc.),  (for retrieving community recipes with filtering and pagination),  (for liking/unliking), and  (for community statistics).
        -   **CORS Configuration**: Updated  to strictly , removing any preview URLs.
        -   **Pydantic Models**: New models for shared recipes were likely introduced to support the new data structures for user-uploaded content.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component, managing UI, routing, and global state.
    -   **Changes**: The trajectory indicates previous authentication persistence fixes. No direct changes were explicitly shown in the provided trajectory for recent work, but it would indirectly use the updated backend. An old API call  was identified and implicitly resolved by updating environment variables.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/StarbucksGeneratorScreen.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The component responsible for generating and displaying Starbucks recipes.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to include a three-tab layout (AI Generator, Curated Recipes, Community), integrating the display of both AI-generated and curated recipes, and providing an interface for sharing user recipes (via a modal) and liking community recipes. Helper components were initially added and then inlined to resolve JSX syntax errors.
-   **/app/frontend/.env** & **/app/frontend/.env.production**:
    -   **Summary**: Store frontend environment variables, primarily .
    -   **Changes**: Repeatedly updated to correctly point to the *production* backend URL (), systematically removing all prior preview URLs.
-   **/app/frontend/public/sw.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Service worker for PWA functionality and caching.
    -   **Changes**:  was incremented to  and  to force cache invalidation and ensure the latest production-focused frontend code is loaded. Preview references were removed.
-   **/app/docs/ (Directory)**:
    -   **Summary**: Contains comprehensive documentation.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **COMPLETE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md**: A new file created to cover the full system overview, deployment, and API integrations. All preview references were removed, focusing strictly on production.
        -   **PRODUCTION_ONLY_POLICY.md**: A new, critical document added to enforce a strict policy against generating or using preview website code, focusing solely on production deployment.
        -   Existing documents (, , , , , ) were updated to remove all preview URLs, configurations, and mentions, explicitly pointing to the production domain.
        -   Old preview-related documentation files (, , ) were deleted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a critical fix for the Walmart product search functionality for the *production site*. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  Search products using their name.
2.  Retrieve the product's name and price using its product ID.
3.  Generate a Walmart affiliate URL using the item IDs.

This follows a major initiative where the previous AI engineer fully cleansed the codebase and documentation of all preview environment references, shifting the entire development focus to a production-only deployment model. This involved updating all  files, CORS settings in , service worker cache versions, and extensively revising all documentation files (, , , , , ) to point exclusively to . A new  was also created and referenced across documentation to enforce this.

Prior to the current Walmart task, the AI engineer successfully implemented and integrated several major features:
*   **Enhanced Starbucks AI Recipe Generation**: Refined prompts for 5 drink types (Frappuccino, Lemonade, Refresher, Iced Matcha, Random) incorporating creative constraints, unique naming conventions, surprise ingredients, and a randomness seed phrase.
*   **Curated Starbucks Recipes**: Added 30 pre-made Starbucks recipes to the database, accessible via new backend endpoints () and categorized by drink type.
*   **User Recipe Sharing System**: Developed a comprehensive community feature allowing users to upload recipes with photos (base64 format), descriptions, tags, difficulty levels, and interact via a like system. This involved new backend APIs (, , , ).
*   **Frontend Integration**: Integrated all the new Starbucks and community features into  with a three-tab layout (AI Generator, Curated Recipes, Community) and a recipe sharing modal. A critical JSX syntax error in this component was identified and fixed, ensuring the frontend compiles successfully.

The current state is that the application is fully configured and tested for production-only deployment, with all new features (enhanced Starbucks AI, curated recipes, user sharing) integrated into the backend and frontend. The immediate task is to refine the Walmart API integration as per the latest user request.
