The previous AI engineer focused on stabilizing an AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App built from scratch, addressing critical UI/UX and functional bugs. Initial efforts revolved around resolving persistent frontend caching issues that prevented UI updates and ensuring the Generate Walmart Shopping Cart function worked reliably, especially for historical recipes. The engineer meticulously debugged by adding and removing logs in , forcing frontend rebuilds, restarting services, and verifying  configurations. A  was even invoked for persistent deployment issues, leading to the insight about caching and old code being served. Later, the focus shifted to a specific user's login issue, which was ultimately resolved by clearing the database and prompting re-registration. The final persistent problem identified was the frontend still using an outdated preview URL despite  being correct, leading to further rebuilds and service restarts to ensure the  backend URL was correctly embedded in the compiled frontend.

The goal is to deliver an AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App featuring personalized AI recipe generation (healthy/budget modes) via OpenAI, real-time Walmart product search, and pre-filled shopping cart URL generation. Key aspects include robust user management with Mailjet for email verification and password reset, intelligent handling of unverified users, and mobile compatibility through PWA/Capacitor. The application aims for a seamless workflow from recipe details to one-click grocery ordering, addressing common browser issues. A strong emphasis is placed on continuous UI/UX refinement for a spotless and professional experience, alongside ensuring application stability, data persistence, and reliable integration readiness for deployment. The current implementation has faced challenges with frontend updates not reflecting due to caching and the Walmart cart generation feature having intermittent issues, particularly with historical recipes. Login issues and ensuring correct frontend-backend URL configuration have also been recent priorities.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React 19**: Frontend framework for dynamic UI.
-   **FastAPI**: Python backend API for efficient request handling.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence.
-   **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: AI for intelligent recipe generation.
-   **Mailjet API**: Third-party email service for verification.
-   **Walmart Affiliate API**: External API for grocery product integration.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Web app installable on mobile devices.
-   **Capacitor**: Toolchain for building native mobile apps from web code.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with React frontend and FastAPI backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application for user authentication, recipe generation, and grocery cart logic. It exposes API endpoints prefixed with .
    -   **Changes**: During this trajectory, CORS configuration was adjusted, and various debug endpoints were temporarily added/removed for user/password/email verification lookup. It also includes the  function, which was mocked for testing. User account details and database clearing functionality were also interactively explored and used for debugging a specific user's login.
-   **/app/backend/email_service.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Handles Mailjet API integration for sending emails (verification, password reset).
    -   **Changes**: No direct code changes in this trajectory, but it was inspected to see if it stored the last reset code, which it did not.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores sensitive backend environment variables like API keys (, , Mailjet, Walmart).
    -   **Changes**: Crucially,  and  were updated to user-provided values ( and ).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The central React component managing UI, routing, global state, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively modified. Debugging console logs were added to  and  functions to diagnose non-working Walmart cart generation, especially for recipes loaded from history. These logs were later removed for preview readiness. UI improvements for grocery cart item display (prices, Walmart URL prominence) were made. It was at the center of debugging frontend caching issues.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores frontend environment variables, primarily .
    -   **Changes**: This file was frequently inspected to verify the backend URL. It was set to  and later changed to  to test local connectivity, then reverted implicitly by the system setup back to the preview URL, leading to further troubleshooting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a persistent issue where the frontend build was using an old preview URL () for API calls, despite the  file correctly showing . This was causing issues with the Walmart URL not showing and no recipe data being displayed for the user.

The engineer's recent actions include:
1.  **Verifying  in **: Confirmed it was set to .
2.  **Forcing a complete frontend rebuild**: Executed  in the frontend directory () to compile the latest code, aiming to embed the correct backend URL.
3.  **Restarting all services**: Issued code-server: stopped
mongodb: stopped
backend: stopped
backend: started
code-server: started
frontend: started
mongodb: started () to ensure all services (backend, frontend, mongodb, code-server) picked up the latest configuration and build.
4.  **Verifying the compiled frontend JavaScript**: Checked  () to confirm that  was correctly embedded in the production build, indicating the fix was applied.

The engineer is currently at the stage of confirming that the frontend is now correctly communicating with the backend using  and is about to perform a final frontend test to validate this. The user's previous feedback indicated that the Walmart URL was not showing, which is directly linked to this frontend-backend connectivity issue.

<optional_next_step>
Conduct a final frontend test to ensure the application is fully functional and the Walmart URL issue is resolved.
