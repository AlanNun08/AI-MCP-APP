The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic boilerplate into an advanced AI-powered recipe and grocery delivery application. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core functionality and progressively adding complex features based on user feedback. Key milestones included integrating OpenAI for recipe generation, implementing a PWA for mobile compatibility, and a significant shift from a mock grocery service to a real Walmart API integration for product search and cart generation. Extensive troubleshooting was performed for environment setup (supervisor,  paths, file watchers) and application logic (OpenAI JSON parsing, frontend-backend connectivity, Pydantic validation, MongoDB serialization). The project culminated in a highly functional app with advanced features like healthy/budget modes, multiple ingredient options, and streamlined user flows, despite persistent public URL access issues which were partially resolved but resurfaced as a blank page. The engineer also initiated Capacitor setup for native builds.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an app for grocery delivering service and Open AI to make recipes and have the ingredients delivered to my house. This evolved into a detailed product vision: an AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App.

Key requirements implemented and refined throughout the trajectory include:
1.  **AI Recipe Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI for personalized recipes, incorporating user preferences like dietary restrictions, allergies, and cuisine types.
2.  **Healthy & Budget Modes**: Users can toggle healthy mode to set calorie limits (300-700 calories) or budget mode for cost-conscious recipes (0-0).
3.  **Grocery Delivery Integration**: Initially planned for a mock service, but shifted to full **Walmart API integration**. This includes searching for real Walmart products based on recipe ingredients, retrieving real prices and product IDs, and generating **Walmart affiliate URLs** that pre-fill a user's cart.
4.  **Ingredient Options**: For budget-conscious shopping, the app provides 3 options (budget, mid-range, premium) per ingredient, allowing users to select preferred items for their custom cart.
5.  **User Management & Recipe Saving**: Users can create accounts, set preferences, and all generated recipes are automatically saved to their profile for history and easy access.
6.  **Mobile App Experience**: The application is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, installable on iOS and Android devices, providing a native-like experience. The setup for converting to true native apps via **Capacitor** was also completed.
7.  **Streamlined Workflow**: After generating a recipe, the user is automatically redirected to the recipe detail page, where the Walmart URL is automatically generated using only ingredient names (quantity default to 1 for simplicity), leading to a one-click shopping experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report that I am clicking on the preview and nothing shows up and nothing shows up. This indicates a persistent issue with the frontend loading via the public URL, specifically a blank page, despite the backend being accessible and fully functional via direct API calls.

The engineer's current focus is on diagnosing and resolving this frontend rendering issue when accessed via the public preview URL. The last action taken was:
 with the thought The build files exist. Let me check if the React app has any errors by switching to development mode temporarily:. This indicates the AI engineer suspects a runtime error or misconfiguration in the React application's production build or environment that prevents it from rendering correctly when served publicly. The change involved setting a  environment variable and conditionally rendering or logging based on it to aid debugging.

The application currently has all core and advanced features implemented:
*   AI recipe generation with OpenAI (healthy/budget modes).
*   Real Walmart API integration for product search and affiliate URL generation (with multiple options).
*   User management and persistent recipe saving.
*   PWA capabilities with Capacitor setup for native builds.
*   Streamlined user flow from recipe generation to one-click grocery ordering.

The core functionality is confirmed working via backend API tests (e.g.,  commands), but the user is unable to experience the full app through the provided public URL, facing a blank page. The previous attempts to fix the public URL issues included:
1.  Increasing system file watcher limits (failed due to read-only filesystem).
2.  Building and serving a production build instead of development server.
3.  Fixing incorrect  binary paths in supervisor configurations.
4.  Switching the frontend's backend URL from public to  (which caused a CORS issue and made public access impossible).
5.  Implementing Demo Mode as a fallback, but the fundamental connectivity issue persists for the *real* app experience.

The current work is directly aimed at making the fully developed application accessible and usable through its public preview URL.

<optional_next_step>
Diagnose the frontend's blank page issue on the public preview URL by analyzing browser console logs for JavaScript errors.
