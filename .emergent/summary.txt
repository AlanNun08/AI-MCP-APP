The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative, problem-solving approach. Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent frontend caching, ensuring UI updates, and implementing a major UI redesign for the recipe detail page, automating the Walmart cart display. Key technical challenges involved debugging Walmart API 403 errors and significantly improving ingredient parsing, culminating in an OpenAI integration for a clean shopping list. The application expanded with distinct Cuisine, Snacks, and Beverages categories, each leveraging specialized AI prompts, especially for secret recipe beverages. Product selection persistence and aggressive code/cache cleanup were also priorities.

Recent efforts centered on refining the OpenAI prompts. First, ensuring the item names only shopping list consistency across all categories was verified. Subsequently, the 4-recipe beverage generation was implemented and tested. The latest critical fix addressed an issue where the frontend was still displaying quantified ingredients in the shopping cart, leading to No product options errors for beverages, which required backend  adjustments and frontend UI changes to correctly use the clean . The final task in progress is to ensure the AI generates *only* the specific beverage type selected by the user, rather than all four pre-defined beverage recipes.

The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to provide personalized AI-generated recipes, integrate with Walmart for real-time product search, and enable one-click grocery ordering via pre-filled shopping cart URLs. It supports user management, intelligent handling of unverified users, and mobile compatibility through PWA/Capacitor.

Key requirements included:
1.  **Frontend Caching Resolution**: Ensure UI updates are always visible, especially for logged-in users.
2.  **Recipe Detail Page**: Automate Walmart cart display, redesign to a two-column layout with sticky cart, stat cards, numbered ingredients, and real-time updates. Delete old UI code.
3.  **Walmart API Integration**: Use real Walmart product IDs, present 3 product options per ingredient with user selection, improve ingredient parsing, and use OpenAI to generate a clean, bullet-pointed shopping list (item names only) for accurate searches.
4.  **Persistent User Selections**: Ensure selections are saved and do not reset after URL copying.
5.  **Enhanced Recipe Categorization**: Implement three top-level categories (Cuisine, Snacks, Beverages) with specific options. Beverages should follow a secret recipe format with detailed ingredients, quantities, steps, and tips, capable of generating 4 unique types (Coffee, Lemonade, Thai Tea, Boba).
6.  **Code Cleanliness**: Continuously remove unused code and ensure aggressive cache clearing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user request: for the beverages it is adding all of them to the prompt, add only the one the user selected to the recipe (Chat Message 245).

The current work focuses on modifying the backend logic to generate only the specific beverage recipe requested by the user, rather than producing all four pre-defined beverage types (Coffee, Lemonade, Thai Tea, Boba) in a single response.

Steps taken:
1.  **Modified 's beverage prompt construction**: The  file was edited to dynamically build the OpenAI prompt based on the user's  selection, ensuring that the AI only generates a recipe for that specific type (Chat Message 247-249).
2.  **Updated JSON Response Format**: The expected JSON response format within the prompt was adjusted to cater to a single recipe structure instead of the previous 4-recipe collection (Chat Message 250-251).
3.  **Revised Beverage Guidelines**: The internal guidelines provided to the AI within the prompt were updated to reflect this single-recipe approach, removing instructions for generating multiple beverage types (Chat Message 252-253).
4.  **Adjusted Beverage Examples**: The examples provided within the prompt were refined to demonstrate single-recipe outputs for each beverage type (Chat Message 254-255).
5.  **Backend Restart**: The backend server was restarted to apply these changes (Chat Message 256-257).

The work is currently at the stage of verifying this specific fix.
