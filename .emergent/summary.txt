The previous AI engineer successfully brought the AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App from an initial MVP state to a fully functional application with real Walmart API integration. The work primarily involved resolving persistent deployment and caching issues, addressing a significant data inconsistency between the backend's intended and actual API responses, and then implementing the real Walmart product search. A critical hurdle was frontend authentication failures on deployment, which was eventually traced to environment variable loading issues. The engineer meticulously debugged and fixed both backend logic (mock data removal, real API calls with RSA authentication) and frontend components ( state management, API field mapping, render loops). The work culminated in a fully operational application where AI-generated recipes link to real Walmart products and pricing. The current task passed on is a UI rebuild for the recipe detail page.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to enhance meal planning and grocery shopping. Its core features include AI-generated recipes, a Starbucks Secret Menu Generator, and a user recipe sharing platform. A central explicit requirement was a robust Walmart integration to identify ingredients from AI-generated recipes, search for corresponding products on Walmart, provide prices, and generate affiliate links. This integration consistently failed on the production deployment, either showing no products found messages or fake product IDs/images. The user explicitly requested ensuring the Walmart search products API is called with real ingredient names after a recipe is generated, to display actual products with prices and images. User session management, frontend caching resolution, and full production readiness were also critical. The most recent request is to rebuild the entire UI page for instructions and selected items, to look different.

    -   **Summary**: The core backend managing recipe generation, authentication, and grocery cart integration.
    -   **Changes**: Initially plagued by Walmart integration failures (mock data, field mismatches). Significant changes involved:
        1.  Removing all mock data for Walmart products from  and  endpoints.
        2.  Implementing real Walmart API integration within  using ,  for RSA-SHA256 authentication, and environment variables for credentials (, , ).
        3.  Ensuring  correctly processes and returns real product data, or a No products found message if the API returns empty.
        4.  Corrected the response model to consistently use  containing  and  for products.

    -   **Summary**: The main React component handling application state, routing, and all major user interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent extensive fixes:
        1.  Updated API response handling to correctly parse backend fields:  changed to  and  to .
        2.  Product image fields updated from  to  for consistency.
        3.  Critical  calls causing infinite render loops within the  function were moved to  hooks for proper state management and navigation.
        4.  Syntax errors and missing braces identified and fixed to ensure correct component rendering and JavaScript execution.
        5.  Debug logging was added and later refined to verify environment variable loading and API call behavior.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and verified the real Walmart API integration, resolving a critical functional gap. The backend () was updated to replace mock product data with actual calls to the Walmart Affiliate API, using RSA-SHA256 authentication and existing environment variables for credentials. This ensured that AI-generated recipe ingredients are now used to search for real Walmart products, returning authentic names, prices, images, and product IDs.

The frontend () was comprehensively reviewed and fixed to ensure 100% functionality. Key  fixes included correcting API response field mappings (e.g.,  instead of ), updating product field references (e.g.,  instead of ), and critically, eliminating  calls within render functions to resolve infinite render loops and ensure stable navigation.

After these fixes, the application's entire flow, including user login (/), recipe generation, real Walmart product display with prices (e.g., a cheesecake recipe costing 2.75 for cheapest options), functional shopping cart, and affiliate link generation, was confirmed to be working perfectly on the live deployed site. The persistent issue of frontend-backend communication due to environment variable loading in production was also identified and resolved, making the deployed application fully operational. The current state is that the app correctly fetches and displays real Walmart product data.
