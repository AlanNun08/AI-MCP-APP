The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative, problem-solving approach. Initially, core features like recipe generation, Walmart integration, and UI were established. A significant focus was on resolving frontend caching and implementing a major UI redesign. Key challenges included debugging Walmart API errors and improving ingredient parsing with OpenAI integration for clean shopping lists. The application expanded with distinct categories, leveraging AI prompts, especially for secret recipe beverages.

Recent work addressed two main user concerns. First, refining OpenAI prompts to generate only the user-selected beverage type, verified via backend testing. Second, fixing persistent issues with Walmart affiliate links for beverages, which was traced to the use of mock product IDs contaminating the links. This involved aggressively clearing all caches (service worker, system), removing extensive mock data from both backend and frontend, and implementing robust validation to ensure only real Walmart product IDs are processed. A critical frontend authentication issue (incorrect backend URL) and a UI dropdown logic error were also identified and resolved during the debugging of the Walmart link problem. The application is now deemed deployment-ready, with all reported issues resolved.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App provides personalized AI-generated recipes, integrates with Walmart for real-time product search, and enables one-click grocery ordering via pre-filled shopping cart URLs. It supports user management, intelligent handling of unverified users, and mobile compatibility through PWA/Capacitor.

Key requirements addressed include:
1.  **Frontend Caching Resolution**: Ensuring UI updates are always visible.
2.  **Recipe Detail Page**: Automating Walmart cart display, redesigning to a two-column layout with a sticky cart, stat cards, numbered ingredients, and real-time updates.
3.  **Walmart API Integration**: Using real Walmart product IDs, presenting 3 product options per ingredient with user selection, improving ingredient parsing, and leveraging OpenAI for a clean, bullet-pointed shopping list (item names only).
4.  **Persistent User Selections**: Ensuring selections are saved and do not reset.
5.  **Enhanced Recipe Categorization**: Implementing Cuisine, Snacks, and Beverages categories. Beverages follow a secret recipe format, generating detailed recipes for a specific user-selected type (Coffee, Lemonade, Thai Tea, Boba).
6.  **Code Cleanliness**: Continuous removal of unused code and aggressive cache clearing.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application for recipe generation, authentication, and grocery cart logic, exposing  prefixed endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Refined  for real API calls and 403 error handling. Enhanced  for parsing. Updated  endpoint's OpenAI prompt to request a bullet-pointed, names-only  for all categories. Modified beverage generation logic to generate only a single specific beverage based on user selection by dynamically constructing the prompt, including updated JSON response format and guidelines. Updated  BaseModel to include . Modified  to use  for Walmart API calls, explicitly changing  to clean ingredient name. Crucially, removed extensive mock product data and hardcoded recipe templates. Added robust validation in  and the custom cart endpoint to filter out mock product IDs (e.g., '10315' pattern) and other invalid formats to ensure only real Walmart product IDs are used.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user request concerning broken Walmart affiliate links for beverages. This involved ensuring correct Walmart item IDs were used, clearing cache, and verifying that the shopping list prompt for beverages only included product names.

The core of this work involved a multi-faceted debugging and fixing process:
1.  **Backend Mock Data Removal**: Identified and removed extensive mock product IDs (especially those starting with '10315') and hardcoded recipe templates from .
2.  **Frontend Mock Data Removal**: Removed all mock product data and the  function from  that was generating fake affiliate URLs.
3.  **Enhanced Validation**: Implemented robust validation in the backend's  and custom cart endpoint to strictly filter out any remaining mock or invalid product IDs, ensuring only real Walmart product IDs are used in affiliate links.
4.  **Cache Clearing**: Performed aggressive cache clearing across the entire stack, including updating the Service Worker's , ensuring , clearing Python and Node.js caches, verifying browser cache headers, and restarting all services (backend, frontend, MongoDB, code-server) to ensure all changes were immediately visible.

During the process of addressing the Walmart link issue, two critical auxiliary problems were identified and fixed:
1.  **Frontend Authentication Failure**: The  in  was incorrectly pointing to a preview URL, preventing proper authentication. This was corrected to , restoring frontend authentication functionality.
2.  **Beverage Dropdown UI Error**: A persistent issue where selecting the Beverages category incorrectly displayed difficulty options instead of beverage types was diagnosed. It was found that a general difficulty dropdown was always rendered, potentially confusing the UI. Unique  attributes were added to both beverage and difficulty dropdowns, and a bug where  was not cleared upon category selection was fixed in .

The backend testing agent successfully verified that the Walmart integration is now working correctly, with all mock data filtered out, and only real product IDs used in affiliate links. The app is declared 100% production-ready for deployment concerning these fixes.
