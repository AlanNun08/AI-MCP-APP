The previous AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a highly iterative and persistent approach to debugging and feature enhancement. Initially, the focus was on addressing various user-reported bugs, primarily related to user authentication (login, registration, password reset), email service functionality, and persistent frontend caching issues. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to resolving a critical problem where the deployed application failed to fetch Walmart products, eventually traced to an incorrect RSA-SHA256 signature generation for the Walmart API. The engineer systematically identified, debugged, and fixed issues across both frontend and backend, including environment variable misconfigurations, database inconsistencies, and aggressive cache invalidation strategies. The trajectory culminates in a comprehensive verification that the Walmart API works correctly for all recipe categories, ensuring the application is production-ready with no mock data and fully functional integrations.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to provide personalized AI-generated recipes, integrate with Walmart for real-time product search, and enable one-click grocery ordering. It supports user management, mobile compatibility, and now, specialized Starbucks secret menu drink generation.

Key requirements addressed throughout development include:
1.  **Frontend Caching**: Ensuring UI updates are always visible and active.
2.  **Recipe Detail Page**: Automating Walmart cart display, with a two-column layout, sticky cart, and interactive product selection.
3.  **Walmart API Integration**: Using real product IDs, presenting options, improving ingredient parsing, and generating a clean, item-name-only shopping list. Critical refinements were made to ensure correct Walmart affiliate URL formats () and that only user-selected items are included.
4.  **Persistent User Selections**: Maintaining user choices across sessions.
5.  **Enhanced Recipe Categorization**: Initially, Cuisine, Snacks, and Beverages. Later, a dedicated Starbucks category was added, and the previous Starbucks functionality within Beverages was removed.
6.  **Code Cleanliness**: Continuous removal of unused/mock code and aggressive cache clearing.
7.  **New User Onboarding**: A creative welcome page and an interactive how-to guide, emphasizing the Walmart login process.
8.  **Categorized History**: Displaying generated recipes (Cuisine, Snacks, Beverages, Starbucks) in a unified, filterable history.
9.  **Starbucks Secret Menu Generator**: A dedicated feature allowing users to generate unique Starbucks drink recipes with specific ordering instructions for drive-thru, with no Walmart integration.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application, handling recipe generation, authentication, grocery cart logic, and Starbucks drink generation.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive debugging and modifications for user authentication, password reset, and email verification logic. Crucially, the Walmart API integration logic in  was heavily revised to correctly handle RSA-SHA256 signature generation, add retry logic, timeouts (increased to 30s), rate limiting (0.8s delay), and enhanced error handling. Ingredient parsing () was improved for beverages. A bug on line 1343 related to recipe saving (Starbucks vs. regular recipes) was fixed. CORS configuration was updated to explicitly allow . Logic to filter out mock/test products and validate product IDs/prices was added. Console log statements related to repeated loads were removed.
-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores sensitive backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was confirmed as . Walmart API credentials (CONSUMER_ID, KEY_VERSION, PRIVATE_KEY) and Mailjet API credentials (API_KEY, SECRET_KEY, SENDER_EMAIL) were present and validated.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing UI, routing, state, and API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Initially changed Welcome Back button to Sign In. Aggressive cache clearing logic was added and then removed following user feedback to stop forced reloads. A version number was added for cache busting. The  constant was updated to  from a preview/placeholder URL. Removed multiple console.log calls that were causing repeated loads.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Summary**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was repeatedly updated from  or preview URLs to  to match the production domain.
-   **/app/frontend/.env.production**:
    -   **Summary**: Environment variables specific to production builds.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to  to resolve connection issues on the deployed site.
-   **/app/frontend/public/sw.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Service worker script for PWA.
    -   **Changes**:  was aggressively updated (e.g.,  to , then , then ) and  for cache invalidation. Forced reload mechanisms were later removed. Cache clearing logic was adjusted to be gentle without reloads.
-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Summary**: Records testing results and user problem statements.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect debugging steps, test outcomes, and summary reports, including comprehensive backend and frontend test results, and explicitly stating task completion and verification for various fixes.
-   **/app/backend/email_service_sendgrid.py (New)**: A new Python file created to provide an alternative email service using SendGrid, in case Mailjet had deployment restrictions.
-   **/app/backend/temp_password_reset.py (New)**: A temporary Python script created to directly reset a user's password in the database for immediate access when email service was failing.
-   **New Documentation & Utility Files (.md, .py, .sh)**: Numerous new files like , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and  were created. These document specific fixes, provide diagnostic tools, and offer deployment instructions or final summaries.
-   **New Frontend Public Scripts (.js, .html)**: , , ,  were created in  to provide various methods for aggressive browser cache clearing.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: The  library was added for the RSA signature fix.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was diligently working on a critical issue reported by the user: the Walmart product search was failing on the deployed site () for all recipe categories, despite previous fixes. The user reported No Walmart products found for any ingredients in the console logs and observed placeholder URLs in network requests.

The engineer's immediate focus was to diagnose and resolve this.
Key actions taken include:
1.  **Debugging Walmart API**: Initial investigation revealed the Walmart API calls were returning 0 products in production, although the infrastructure appeared functional. A direct diagnostic tool () and a direct Walmart API test script () were created to pinpoint the problem.
2.  **RSA Signature Fix**: The root cause was identified as an incorrect Walmart API signature generation, specifically Signature length not correct: got 32 but was expecting 256. The  function in  was rewritten to correctly use RSA-SHA256 signing, requiring the  library (added to ).
3.  **Environment Variable Verification**: Ensured , , and  were correctly configured.
4.  **Mock Data Elimination**: The system was rigorously checked and modified to ensure absolutely no mock data was being used, and only real user recipes were processed for Walmart product search. This included adding strict product ID, name, and price validations.
5.  **Frontend Cache Invalidation**: Despite previous attempts, the deployed site was still serving old JavaScript files. The engineer implemented an even more aggressive cache-busting strategy by:
    *   Updating the service worker version (to ) and ensuring it forces a complete cache refresh.
    *   Creating a new production build () to ensure fresh code with the correct backend URLs was deployed.
    *   Providing manual browser console scripts for the user to force clear their browser cache.
6.  **Database Naming Consistency**: Addressed the user's query about database naming ( vs ), recommending a brand-aligned  but confirming current name functions.

The current state is that the Walmart API integration is fully fixed, returning real products for all recipe categories (cuisine, beverage, snacks), and all mock data references have been eliminated. The application is deemed 100% ready for production deployment.
