<analysis>
The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative, user-feedback driven development approach. Key initial features included recipe generation, Walmart integration, and a React UI. The trajectory shows a continuous cycle of addressing user-reported bugs and implementing new features. Significant efforts were dedicated to debugging and refining the Walmart affiliate link generation, which involved multiple iterations of correcting URL formats ( vs ,  vs ), filtering mock data, and ensuring only selected items were included. Authentication issues and frontend caching problems were also identified and resolved. A major feature addition involved creating a dedicated Starbucks Secret Menu generator with a unique drive-thru themed UI, requiring the old Starbucks integration from the main recipe generator to be cleanly removed. Finally, a comprehensive new user onboarding and tutorial system, along with categorized recipe history, were implemented, showcasing a focus on user experience and clarity.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App aims to provide personalized AI-generated recipes, integrate with Walmart for real-time product search, and enable one-click grocery ordering. It supports user management, mobile compatibility, and now, specialized Starbucks secret menu drink generation.

Key requirements addressed throughout development include:
1.  **Frontend Caching**: Ensuring UI updates are always visible and active.
2.  **Recipe Detail Page**: Automating Walmart cart display, with a two-column layout, sticky cart, and interactive product selection.
3.  **Walmart API Integration**: Using real product IDs, presenting options, improving ingredient parsing, and generating a clean, item-name-only shopping list. Critical refinements were made to ensure correct Walmart affiliate URL formats () and that only user-selected items are included.
4.  **Persistent User Selections**: Maintaining user choices across sessions.
5.  **Enhanced Recipe Categorization**: Initially, Cuisine, Snacks, and Beverages. Later, a dedicated Starbucks category was added, and the previous Starbucks functionality within Beverages was removed.
6.  **Code Cleanliness**: Continuous removal of unused/mock code and aggressive cache clearing.
7.  **New User Onboarding**: A creative welcome page and an interactive how-to guide, emphasizing the Walmart login process.
8.  **Categorized History**: Displaying generated recipes (Cuisine, Snacks, Beverages, Starbucks) in a unified, filterable history.
9.  **Starbucks Secret Menu Generator**: A dedicated feature allowing users to generate unique Starbucks drink recipes with specific ordering instructions for drive-thru, with no Walmart integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on refining the user experience for the landing page. Specifically, the last task was to change the Welcome Back button text to Sign In on the application's landing page to provide clearer guidance for existing users, making it distinct from the Start Cooking for Free button for new registrations.

This change involved modifying the  file to update the button's display text. The services (frontend) were then restarted to ensure the change was live and immediately visible to the user. This task was successfully completed, resulting in a more intuitive user interface for the application's entry point. The application is now fully functional, with all previously identified issues resolved and new features implemented.
