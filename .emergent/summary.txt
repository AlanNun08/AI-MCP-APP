<analysis>
The previous AI engineer meticulously worked on the AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App, transitioning it from MVP to a production-ready state. A significant persistent challenge involved the Walmart API integration, which consistently failed to display products and prices despite passing internal tests. The root cause evolved from authentication and demo user verification issues to pervasive frontend and backend caching/deployment problems. The engineer systematically addressed:
1.  **Demo User Authentication:** Initial fixes and troubleshooting by both the engineer and a sub-agent aimed to resolve unverified user status, revealing a complex interaction of database state, frontend caching, and environment variable misconfigurations.
2.  **Walmart Integration Functionality:** Debugged issues where the API returned no products found or 500 errors, tracing them to overly aggressive relevance filtering and later, a complete lack of product data.
3.  **Deployment Discrepancies:** Multiple attempts to fix the above revealed a profound issue where changes made to the codebase were not reflected in the deployed production environment, despite restarts and cache clearings. This was the ultimate blocker by the end of the trajectory, suggesting an infrastructure-level deployment or routing problem.

<product_requirements>
The AI Recipe + Grocery Delivery App is designed to enhance meal planning and grocery shopping. Its core features include:
-   **AI-Generated Recipes:** Personalized recipes based on user inputs (dietary, allergies, ingredients, prep time, servings, difficulty, health, budget).
-   **Walmart Integration:** Automatic matching of recipe ingredients with real Walmart products, displaying prices, and generating one-click affiliate purchase URLs.
-   **Starbucks Secret Menu Generator:** A unique feature for creative drink ideas.
-   **User Recipe Sharing Platform:** Allows users to share recipes with image uploads, tags, descriptions, and a like system.
The application also required robust user session management, resolution of frontend caching issues, enhanced recipe history display, and full production readiness with all preview environment references removed. The primary problem encountered was the persistent failure of the Walmart integration on the deployed production site.

<code_architecture>
The application features a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database, optimized for Kubernetes container deployment.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The central FastAPI backend managing all API endpoints including recipe generation, user authentication, grocery cart integration (Walmart), Starbucks drink generation, and user recipe sharing.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple debugging attempts involved adding and removing logging, fixing database connection issues by removing a problematic  function, and correcting conflicting route decorators (changing all  to ). The core  endpoint was repeatedly debugged for the Walmart integration. Most recently, a  endpoint was added to verify code deployment, with a  version parameter (e.g., ).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The primary React component responsible for application state, routing, user authentication, and integrating various screens.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a deep debugging session concerning the persistent failure of the Walmart integration on the *deployed production site*. Despite multiple rounds of fixes, testing agent confirmations, and user rejections, the application continued to report No Walmart products found or exhibit login issues.

The core problem was initially diagnosed as an authentication problem related to the demo user, which was painstakingly debugged across frontend and backend, involving database updates, environment variable corrections, and multiple service restarts. The backend testing agent repeatedly (and falsely) confirmed success, while the frontend () continued to show the email verification screen or report product failures.

A critical discovery was that the  file was incorrectly pointing to a  URL, which was corrected. However, this fix did not resolve the issue on the production site. Further investigation revealed a more fundamental deployment problem: changes made to the  file, including adding new debug logs and a  endpoint with a version string (), were *not* being reflected in the deployed production environment (it consistently returned ).

Attempts to resolve this included:
1.  **Extensive code cleanup:** Deleting old test/debug scripts.
2.  **Refactoring backend:** Identifying and fixing critical issues in  such as duplicate database connection initializations and conflicting FastAPI route decorators ( vs. ).
3.  **Cache clearing:** Manual cache clearing via  and  invalidation, along with numerous backend: stopped
code-server: stopped
mongodb: stopped
backend: started
code-server: started
frontend: started
mongodb: started commands.
4.  **Process management:** Attempting to kill lingering Python processes and forcing complete restarts.

Despite all these efforts, the  code deployed to production remained an older version, preventing any fixes, including the Walmart integration or debug logs, from taking effect. The last action was an attempt to modify an error message format in  to confirm if *any* changes were being picked up, and it also failed to reflect in production.

The next step is to diagnose the underlying deployment/Kubernetes configuration issue preventing new code from reaching the production environment.
